## Assignment Reflection

Please reflect on your experience with this assignment. What was most challenging? What was most interesting?  What did you learn that you might use again?

- It was hard understanding logistically how the command line stuff worked, mainly about codeFile, because we have used '<' and '>', but codeFile was unfamiliar. 
- It was also interesting learning the different ways that we can approach this problem and find our own solution creatively (but still logically, of course). 
- Finally, I think I'll ask for help more! I still have a lot to learn and asking for help has enriched my understanding more often than not.
